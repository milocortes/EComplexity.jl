# Economic Complexity

The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and the product complexity index (PCI) are metrics that infers information about countriesâ€™ productive capabilities from their export baskets.

The ECI and PCI measures are calculated using an algorithm that operates on a binary country-product matrix ``M`` with elements ``M_{cp}=1`` if country ``c`` has a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) > 1 in product ``p``, where RCA is calculate using the Balassa index:

```math 
    \begin{equation}
        RCA_{c,p} =\dfrac{x(c,p)}{\sum_i x(c,p)} \Bigg/  \dfrac{\sum_c x(c,p)}{\sum_{c,p} x(c,p)}
    \end{equation}
```

where ``x_{cp}`` is country ``c``'s exports of product ``p``. RCA  measures whether a country `` c`` exports more of a product `` p``, as a share of its total exports, than the "average" country (`` RCA>1`` not ``RCA<1``). 


## Proximity
Formally, the proximity ``\phi`` between products ``i`` and ``j`` is the minimum of the pairwise conditional probabilities of a country exporting a good given that it exports another.

```math 
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_{i,j} = \min \big\lbrace P(RCAx_i|RCAx_j),P(RCAx_j|RCAx_i) \big\rbrace 
    \end{equation}    
```


## Distance
```math
\begin{equation}
    d_{cp} = \dfrac{\sum_{p'}(1-M_{cp'}) \phi_{pp'}}{\sum_{p'} \phi_{pp'}}
\end{equation}
```
